# Raspberry Pi B Digital Dashboard

## Main Idea : To create a a portable speedometer that can give reading for velocity,speed & acceleration using a Raspberry Pi 3 B 
I am going to attach some good-to-have links for pinouts,schematic diagrams and manuals

## Oct 30th - Progress Report
### Activities versus the schedule
Everything is on schedule as I have the Raspberry Pi and screen working :white_check_mark:

### Current Progress 
As of now I have the Adafruit Capactive Touchscreen working on top of my Raspberry pi B. Got both the screen and the touch working well! To get the screen to work I ran a script that Adafruit provided.

### This is the script file

1. cd ~
2. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts/master/adafruit-pitft.sh
3. chmod +x adafruit-pitft.sh
4. sudo ./adafruit-pitft.sh


### Problems and Opportunities

The most frequent problem that I ran into was choosing the incorrect display driver when running the script on my raspberry pi. Installing the incorrect driver can casue issues for the display. Also I chose to use gui mode as terminal mode doesnt allow for any gui. 

### Financial Status

No extra money was spent on this project
